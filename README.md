It also shows which meganation a town is part of on the popup, as well as the town's size in chunks and also changes the flags to phrases:

## Updates

If you want a meganation updated/added/recolored, either:

- Open a [pull request](https://github.com/32Vache/emc-map-colors/pulls) (if you know how to update json yourself)
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/32Vache/emc-map-colors/issues) (if you do not know)

## Installation

You will need [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) to run this userscript.
Once you got it installed you can just download the userscript from [releases](https://github.com/32Vache/emc-map-colors/releases/latest)!

## Compatibility

This userscript is compatible with Tampermonkey version 4.9 or later. If you use Firefox, check out [this firefox addon](https://github.com/3meraldK/earthmc-dynmapcolor) instead.
